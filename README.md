# EDA and Hypothesis Testing Two Sample Unequal Variance Exercise

# Exercise 1

1. Test the relationship between the time of day (lunch or dinner) and the total bill:
- What are your statistical hypotheses?

     - H0: mu1 = mu2 or mu1 + mu2 = 0
     - Ha: mu1 != mu2 or mu1 + mu2 != 0
     
- Are your results statistically significant? What evidence does this lend to your hypotheses?

- What is the estimated effect size?
        
2. Answer the same questions, but for the relationship between the time of day and the tip.

# Excercise 2

1. Test the relationship between the time of day (lunch or dinner) and the tip:
